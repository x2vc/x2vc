# IDE Recommendations

## General

Regardless of the IDE, a sufficiently recent JDK is required as specified in [the installation instructions](installation.html).
No system-wide installation required, but it needs to be usable from within the IDE.

## Eclipse

The author recommends using the most recent version of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) (at least 2023-06). The following
documentation assumes you are starting with the pre-packaged
[Eclipse IDE for Java Developers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/).
When using a different installation, additional steps may be necessary.

It is recommended to set the JDK as workspace default to avoid having to change project configuration.
