/**
 * A request to the XML document generator to produce an XML document. A request consists of a set of rules for the XML
 * document generator to use and generate a document.
 *
 * Requests can be normalized so that all requests that produce an XML document of a certain structure and value set are
 * identical.
 *
 * A request is associated with the XML schema version it is based on.
 *
 * A request may contain additional information about values that have been specifically requested by the XSS
 * vulnerability checker (i. e. specific requests to change the value of an attribute, text, comment or the XML document
 * tree to cover copy-of-clauses). This information is carried through to the generated document.
 *
 * A request may also contain additional information about specific requests to change the value of an attribute, text,
 * comment or the selection of a particular sub-element issued by the XSLT coverage optimizer.
 *
 * XML document requests offer efficient comparison and hash value generation (required for task reconciliation).
