x2vc - XSLT XSS Vulnerability Checker
Copyright 2023 x2vc authors and contributors

  ABOUT
=========

x2vc is a tool to check XSLT programs (aka stylesheets) that transform XML data
into HTML output. It attempts to identify paths by which XML input data can be
used to perform Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

  STATUS
==========

Please note that this is a pre-release version that is not feature-complete an
can not yet be considered production-ready (if a tool such as this can ever
be). Exercise caution, make frequent backups and treat the results with more
caution than usual.

  REQUIREMENTS
================

x2vc requires at least Java 20 installed (check using java -version on the
command line). All other required libraries are bundled in the distribution
archive.

  INSTALLATION
================

Unzip the distribution file in a location of your choice (no administrative
privileges required). For convenience, it is recommended to add the bin/
directory to your search path environment variable.

  USE
=======

Using the command line, navigate to the folder that contains the XSLT programs.
Then execute
  x2vc <mode> <file(s)>
where <mode> can be one of
  schema - attempt to generate or extend the schema file, then exit
  xss    - only perform an XSS check using the existing schema, then exit
  full   - generate/extend the schema, then perform the XSS check
It is possible to specify more than one file by listing individual files
or using wildcards.
